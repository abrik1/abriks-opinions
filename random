The Solitary Path

Aham bhavāmi, ekākī, nirjanāntare
Svayam eva, vijñānam, prakaṭayāmi
Antarātmānam, anveshayāmi, nirvikalpena
Brahmabhūtaḥ, bhavāmi, nirlepaḥ

Translation:
I am, alone, in solitude.
I reveal knowledge, by myself.
I seek the inner self, without distraction.
I become the divine, untouched.

The Dual Path

Avaḥ bhavāvaḥ, mitrābhyām, saṃgītamāḥ
Saṃvādam kurvāvaḥ, jñānam samuddhṛtya
Anubhavāmaḥ, ekātmatvam, hṛdayena hṛdayam
Bhavāvaḥ, saṃyuktāḥ, brahmāṇḍam paśyāvaḥ

Translation:
We two are, friends, united in song.
We converse, uplifting knowledge.
We experience oneness, heart to heart.
We are united, seeing the universe.

The Collective Path

Vayam bhavāmaḥ, saṃgītāḥ saṃgītāḥ
Ekātmānam anubhūya, nṛtyāmaḥ gaṇāḥ
Prītibandhena saṃyuktaḥ, hṛdayāni militaḥ
Divyaṃ dṛśyaṃ prakaṭayāmaḥ, saṃgīta-nṛtya-kāvyena

Translation:
We are, united in song and dance.
Experiencing oneness, we dance as a group.
Bound by love, our hearts are united.
We reveal the divine through music, dance, and poetry.

The Transcendent Path

Sarve bhavāmaḥ, ekātmabhāvam anubhūya
Brahmāṇḍam paśyāmaḥ, sarvatra sarvadā
Nānātvaṃ ekatve, līnaṃ bhavati
Divyaṃ caitanyam, prakaṭīkṛtam
