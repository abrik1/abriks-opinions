This goes even worse when you start to get attention of scammers and hackers. These people can find about your banking details, your real life location and other sensitive information. Technology can also play a significant role in mood swinging because of addiction. This may affect our communication skills, sleep and work cycle. With the rise of AI's many employees are getting fired causing unemployment.
